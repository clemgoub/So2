# TE consensus clustering

This script cluster TE consensus sequences generated by one or more program such as `Repeat Modeler (1/2)`, `EDTA`, `LTR-finder`...

The pipeline used `MAFFT` to align sequences and `MOTHUR` to cluster them. Each cluster is then polished and a new consensi is build using `REFINER` (a module of RepeatModeler 2).

## Dependencies

Must be available in the `$PATH`

- `MAFFT` -- [link/install:](https://github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft)
- `Mothur` -- [link/install:](https://github.com/mothur/mothur/releases/tag/v1.45.2)
- `Refiner`-- [executable:](https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler/blob/master/Refiner)-(also included with `RepeatModeler 2`)

## Usage

*DO not add the ".fasta" extension to your library name in the following command:*

```./combine.TE.library.sh TE.library.name```
