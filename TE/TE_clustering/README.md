# TE consensi clustering

This script cluster TE consensi sequences generated by one or more program such as Repeat Modeler (1/2), EDTA, LTR-finder...

The pipeline used MAFFT to align sequences and MOTHUR to cluster them. Each cluster is then polished and a new consensi is build using REFINER (a module of RepeatModeler 2).

## Dependencies

MAFFT, Mothur and Refiner must be available in the $PATH

## Usage

*DO not add the ".fasta" extension to your library name in the following command:*

```./combine.TE.library.sh TE.library.name```
